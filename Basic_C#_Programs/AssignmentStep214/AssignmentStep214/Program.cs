//ASSIGNMENT (Step 214)
//Perform these actions and create a console app that includes the following:
//1.Create a list of integers. Ask the user for a number to divide each number in the list by. 
//Write a loop that takes each integer in the list, divides it by the number the user entered, and displays the result to the screen.
//2. Run the code, entering in non-zero numbers as the user. Look at the displayed results.
//3. Run the code again, entering in zero as the number to divide by. Note any error messages you get.
//4. Run the code once again, entering in a string as the number to divide by. Note any error messages you get.
//5. Now put the loop in a try/catch block. Below and outside of the try/catch block, make the program print a message to the display
//to let you know the program has emerged from the try/catch block and continued on with program execution. 
//In the catch block, display the error message to the screen. Then try various combinations of user input: valid numbers, zero and a string. 
//Ensure the proper error messages display on the screen, and that the code after the try/catch block gets executed.
